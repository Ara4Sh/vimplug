# vimplug

A simple shell script to manage Vim plugins.

## Features
* No need to add any configuration to vimrc
* Manage your plugins from within Vim and Bash
* Simple and intuitive

## Requirements
The only dependency of vimplug is Bash, however, [pathogen] is recommended to
manage Vim's runtime path. Vimplug looks for a directory named `bundle` in your
`$HOME/.vim` directory but it can be configured.

## Installation
Simply install it in a directory which is in your execution $PATH.
